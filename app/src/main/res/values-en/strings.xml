    <string name="makna">Tulips are generally regarded as a symbol of perfect love. Their elegant shape and the variety of their colors often associate them with declarations of love and expressions of beauty that cannot be spoken. Additionally, tulips can symbolize renewal and revival, as they often bloom at the beginning of spring when nature awakens from its winter slumber. With a rich history and a prominent presence in culture and art, tulips indeed hold a special place as one of the most beloved and cherished flowers.</string>
